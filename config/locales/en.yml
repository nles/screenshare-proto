# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      faq_text_html: "<b>What is Teleporting Screen?</b><br>
Teleporting Screen is a service for sharing your screen with anyone, without them needing to install any additional programs. This service uses WebRTC technology for sharing your screen image.<br>
<br>
<b>What is WebRTC?</b><br>
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an API definition drafted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that supports browser-to-browser applications for voice calling and video chat without the need of either internal or external plugins.<br>
<br>
<b>Why doesn't the sharing work?</b><br>
Teleporting Screen currently works only on Chromium and Google Chrome browsers. We are working on supporting more browsers soon.<br>
<br>
<b>Does this work on mobile devices?</b><br>
You should at least be able to see your friends stream from some mobile browsers. No guarantees yet.<br>
<br>
<b>Is Teleporting Screen safe?</b><br>
Short answer: Yes! Only the image of your screen is being shared, so there is no possibility for anyone to take control of your screen. All communication between you and the receiver is encrypted using the DTLS and SRTP protocols.<br>
<br>
<b>How many people I can connect to?</b><br>
Since the connection is peer-to-peer, this depends a lot on your connection speed. Sharing for up to 4 people should work with a decent quality.<br>
<br>
<b>Need more help?</b><br>
Please contact us through teleporting.screen@gmail.com. We are happy to help you."
